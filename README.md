An AI based Psychometric Test Software 

A web application to group like-minded people in a team based on their overall potential ability in the organization. Assessing and appraising people is a highly complex and subjective process, and psychometric tests are a good way of objectively assessing people's "hidden" traits.
From recruitment to long-term career development, these tests provide a great deal of reliable information to make important personnel decisions.
